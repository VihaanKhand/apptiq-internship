### Questions / Actions (2025-04-26)

1. **Full Error Log** – please paste the entire stack-trace or log output that appears when Windsurf shows `failed to initialize: request failed`.
I don't know where that is located can you point me to it?

2. **Server Log Confirmation** – after the failure, does `dist/mcp-startup.log` still show the line `Connected via stdio transport.`?
Can you not check the log file?

3. **SDK Version Mismatch** – in the VS Code terminal, run `npm ls @modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and paste the output so we can verify the client/server versions match.
can you not run that? 
(base) PS E:\code\github-actions-mcp-server> npm ls @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
github-actions-mcp@0.1.0 E:\code\github-actions-mcp-server
`-- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.10.1

4. **Proxy / Firewall** – are you running behind a proxy, VPN, or firewall that could block subprocesses or stdio pipes?  If yes, please give details.
No proxy or VPN, just windows firewall which is open outbound
